// Make a program that calculates and prints the sum of the series from $number1 to $number2. Give values of your choosing to these variables (in real-life case theyâ€™d most likely come from a form in web page). E.g. if the values are 1 and 5, the program should calculate 1+2+3+4+5 and print the value 15.

**Extra challenge: Print the calculation too. You may need a conditional statement (if) to avoid printing an extra plus sign to the end.
