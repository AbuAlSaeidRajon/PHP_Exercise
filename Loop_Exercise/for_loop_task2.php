// Make a program that calculates and prints the sum of the series from $number1 to $number2. Give values of your choosing to these variables (in real-life case theyâ€™d most likely come from a form in web page). E.g. if the values are 1 and 5, the program should calculate 1+2+3+4+5 and print the value 15.

**Extra challenge: Print the calculation too. You may need a conditional statement (if) to avoid printing an extra plus sign to the end.

<?php
$number1 = 1;
$number2 = 5; 

$sum = 0;
$calculation = '';

for ($i = $number1; $i <= $number2; $i++) {
    $sum += $i;
    $calculation .= $i;

    if ($i < $number2) {
        $calculation .= ' + ';
    }
}

print "The sum of the series from $number1 to $number2 is: $sum\n";
print "Calculation: $calculation = $sum";
